            This is a quick guide on how to dissasemble and reassemble the swerve drives's 
            wheels for replacement. Make sure to replace these as often as possible during 
            a match to make sure the robot has enought traction
            <span>
                Step 1: Remove the swerve drive wheel from the swerve drive. There is one long
                black hex-screw which holds the wheel on.

                Step 2: Remove the shaft and washers/spacers.

                Step 3: Take out the bearings on either side.

                Step 4: Remove the 6 hex bolts holding the gear and flat plate mounts on the wheel.
                Make sure when removing to use an opposit-pattern to remove screws, like this

                Step 5: Now That you have fully dissasembled the wheel, get a new wheel (the rubbe part).
                Do a visual check when getting a new tire to see if it should be used.
                Repeat the same steps backwards to reassemble. Make sure to put the gear plate on first,
                line up the holes, but on the second plate, line up the holes, and then insert the screws.
                Otherwise, the alignment gets all screwed up (punintended).

                Step 6: When reinserting into the swerve drive itself, find the gear side of the wheel (left),
                and align it with this gear shown in the swerve housing (right).

                Step 7: Finally, reinsert long hex screw from the first step. It can only go in on one side of 
                the swerve, so it should be obvious.
